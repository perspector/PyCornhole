## Installing
There are two options for installing:
### 1. Terminal
Open your terminal and type:\
`git clone https://github.com/perspector/PyCornhole.git`

It should go into the folder you ran the command in.

### 2. Downloading the ZIP file
You can download the .zip file by pressing "download as ZIP" in the repository.\
The .zip file should go into your /Downloads folder.

## Running
### Option 1: Run the Python Program Through Your File Manager
Just double click *CornHole.py*, it should be an excecutable python script.\
If that doesn't work, open *CornHole.py* in your python editor, and run it. [Geany](https://www.geany.org/) or [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) are recommended but not required. **Also make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.**
### Option 2: Run from the Command Line
Just go into the folder you installed PyCornhole into, and type the following commands:\
`cd PyCornhole`\
`python3 CornHole.py`


I made the program so it automatically installs all dependencies. **_Please make sure you have an internet connection the first time you run the program!_**

I hope you like the program! If you have any questions or problems, please [create an issue](https://github.com/BennyThePythonCoder/PyCornhole/issues) in this repository.
